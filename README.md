# Freddy Lau Portfolio

## Description
In this project I made a porfolio that presented my name, logo, links to sections: about me, my work and a contact section. I made the navigation scroll to the corresponding sections. In my "work" section, my first project is  larger than the rest. Also, the webpage has a responsive layout to be resized.
